            "This course is the first part of the education in circuit design, analysis and testing. In the lecture, the
            students will learn to apply circuit analysis techniques to solve basic electrical networks and to propose
            electrical network solutions to engineering problems. In the technical skill training the student will learn
            about basic electrical measurement equipment and circuits. The technical skill training is about writing
            technical reports."

        This book contains explanations for circuit analysis techniques. It not a must-have, but it is convenient as it
        provides more than enough practice exercises. In addition, this book will be used again in the <i>Networks</i>
        part of <i>Electronic Circuits 1</i>.

                <li>This course has no list of mandatory exercises. The exercises from the lectures are roughly
                    representative of the level of the questions at the exam. Re-doing some exercises from the slides
                    might therefore be useful.

                <li>Even though no "lists" of exercises are given, it is worth spending some time solving problems from
                    the book. The lectures follow the structure of the book, so finding a suitable exercise shouldn't be
                    a problem.

                    reading relevant chapters from the reader, reading the lab exercises in advance, making notes of
                    these and
                    perhaps already drawing some schematics.
