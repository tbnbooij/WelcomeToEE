        <ul>
            <li>Calculus - a complete course (Adams/Essex, 8th edition)</li>
        </ul>
        This <b>behemoth</b> of a book is definitely worth picking up. It not only contains thousands of exercises and
        explanations, but is also used in the course <i>Mathematics 1</i> (quartile 3).
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Algebraic skills (EN)/Dictaat Rekenvaardigheden (NL)</li>
        </ul>
        This one is useful if you struggled with the starttest.
        <ul>
            <li>Lecture notes 'Vectors in plane and space' (NL/EN)</li>
        </ul>
        This PDF-file (available online) will teach you about vectors, dot products and cross products, which are part
        of
        this course's  material.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Handout 'Notes on sets'</li>
        </ul>
        This handout contains basic mathematical notation that is used throughout the course.
        <ul>
            <li><b><u>Your own notes</u></b></li>
        </ul>
        Studying directly from the book is quite tough. Therefore, I <b>highly</b> advise you to take readable and
        extensive
        notes during the lectures. You'll thank yourself later for this, trust me.

            <li>It doesn't matter whether you use the 7th or the 8th edition of the book. The exercises are largely the same.</li>
